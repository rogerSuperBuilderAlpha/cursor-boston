# Welcome to Cursor Boston!

We're excited to launch **Cursor Boston** — a community for exploring and discussing AI-powered development with Cursor right here in Beantown.

## What is Cursor Boston?

Cursor Boston is a local chapter of the global Cursor community. We bring together developers, designers, students, startup founders, and anyone curious about how AI can supercharge their development experience.

Whether you're deep into your daily `.cursor` flow or just getting started with AI-assisted coding, this community is for you.

## What to Expect

We're planning a variety of events including:

- **Workshops** — Hands-on sessions to learn Cursor features and workflows
- **Meetups** — Networking, demos, and discussions with fellow Cursor users
- **Hackathons** — Build projects together using AI-powered development tools
- **University Sessions** — Events at MIT, Harvard, Hult, and other Boston-area schools

## Who's This For?

Everyone! Our events welcome:

- **Students** from MIT, Harvard, Hult, BU, Northeastern, and beyond
- **Startup founders** looking to prototype and ship faster
- **Professional developers** wanting to level up their workflow
- **Designers and PMs** exploring AI-assisted development
