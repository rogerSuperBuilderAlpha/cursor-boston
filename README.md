## 🏙️ What is Cursor Boston?

Cursor Boston is a community-led platform designed to bring together the most ambitious developers, students, and founders in the Boston area. We focus on **AI-native development workflows**—leveraging tools like Cursor to ship production code at the speed of thought.

### 🎯 Who is this for?
- **🎓 Students**: MIT, Harvard, Hult, BU, Northeastern, and beyond.
- **🚀 Founders**: Prototype MVPs in hours and validate ideas fast.
- **💻 Developers**: Master the art of AI-assisted full-stack development.
- **🎨 Designers & PMs**: Bridge the gap between design and production code.

## 🛠️ The Build Stack

This platform is a living example of what you can build with Cursor and modern web tech:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- **Integrations**: Discord/GitHub OAuth, Luma API, Framer Motion
